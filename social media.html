        <p>
            The term social media refers to a computer-based technology that facilitates the sharing of ideas, thoughts,
            and information through virtual networks and communities. Social media is internet-based and gives users
            quick electronic communication of content, such as personal information, documents, videos, and photos.
            Users engage with social media via a computer, tablet, or smartphone via web-based software or applications.
            While social media is ubiquitous in America and Europe, Asian countries like Indonesia lead the list of
            social media usage.

    <h2>why use social media</h2>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.CzKdMLMbuYO18n4KlZdPWgHaLc?pid=ImgDet&rs=1">
    <p>
        The use of social media has been a growing trend over the past few years. Many people have chosen social media
        as a preferable way to spend their free time, rather than watching TV or playing games. Over 3 billion people
        use social media platforms daily, with the average media consumption being 11 hours a day, but most of us don’t
        stop to ask why we’re using that platform, and what it is replacing in our lives.
